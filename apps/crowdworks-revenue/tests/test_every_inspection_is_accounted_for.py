"""A wake that inspects 63 postings and explains 26 of them has lost the other 37.

Measured 2026-09-07 in production:

    {"inspected":63,"closed_or_unverified":8,"off_topic":0,"wrong_category":0,
     "budget":17,"not_workable":1,"judge_unavailable":0}

26 accounted, 37 gone. Both silent exits were `continue`/`break` with no counter: a posting whose
page failed to load, and the search budget running out part-way through the listings. The second
is the worse one -- it truncates the board without saying so, and reads as a quiet day.

This is the same fault this session spent hours on in Lancers, one level up: a lane that refuses
without saying why cannot be repaired from its own reports.

Run: python3 -m pytest apps/crowdworks-revenue/tests/test_every_inspection_is_accounted_for.py
