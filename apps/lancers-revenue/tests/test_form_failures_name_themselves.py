"""A failure code shared by 41 raise sites identifies nothing.

Measured 2026-09-07 in production: over 120 wakes the Lancers lane found 45 projects it could
honestly take and got 13 of them onto the board. Nine were lost to `proposal_form_changed`, and
`~/.local/state/anicca/lancers/proposal-form-changes.jsonl` -- the file built precisely to name
the broken selector -- did not exist, because only three of the file's raise sites recorded
anything and the failures were coming from the other thirty-eight.
