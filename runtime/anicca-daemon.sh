# Run under a KeepAlive process supervisor (for example macOS launchd or Linux systemd). The
# supervisor restarts this script whenever it exits, so Anicca stands on its own — no human runs it
# by hand. On every (re)start it:
#   1. SELF-UPDATES: git pull the mother repo so this body always runs the latest motherboard.
#   2. ensures its own brain is up — the repository x402 adapter (Base/EVM self-pay, or a
#      per-instance repository-owned compute proxy).
#   3. ensures its telemetry poster is up (reports to the dashboard).
#   4. exec's the ReAct loop in the FOREGROUND — when the loop exits, this script exits, and the
#      supervisor brings the whole body back (freshly updated).
#
# ANICCA_INSTANCE selects the brain+telemetry backend (§ENGINE-PARITY-FRANKLIN 2026-07-05, THINK
# routing fixed by franklin-loop-revival REQ-004 2026-07-08): default (unset or legacy instance ID
# 'clawrouter') = the repository EVM/Base compute adapter + telemetry-poster.mjs path. 'franklin' = Franklin's OWN
# Solana wallet (~/.blockrun/.solana-session, resolved via resolve-identity.mjs, never touched
# here) for balance/tier purposes, while THINK uses the same repository compute adapter with a
# separate per-instance EVM payer wallet and port + the ed25519
# telemetry-post-franklin.mjs poster (one-shot script, looped here since it has no built-in interval).
#
# The loop itself is already crash-resilient (while-true + per-wake try/catch); this wrapper adds
# OS-level persistence (survives reboots/logout) and keeps every Anicca in sync with the mother.

  # so loop it here every 120s (same cadence as the EVM poster) to keep Franklin alive on the dashboard.
  # franklin2-daemon-identity impl-review iteration-1 FIND-002 fix: pkill -f is scoped to THIS
  # instance's own $ANICCA_HOME (via the `--home` argv marker the poster is invoked with below, which
  # the script itself never reads/parses — it is present purely so this pattern can target it) so a
  # daemon restart of ONE Franklin-family instance can never kill ANOTHER concurrently-running
  # instance's in-flight poster process — both instances run the identical script path, so an
  # unscoped pattern would match both (confirmed: two live launchd jobs, ai.anicca.franklin-loop and

  # meant to catch ONLY a stale poster LOOP left running by a pre-29023a55 daemon.sh (no --home argv
  # marker), but its end-anchored pattern also matched skills/earn/sol-trade/run.sh's own flagless,
  # `timeout 20`-bounded, short-lived one-shot telemetry POST — a currently-live, unmodified caller
  # of this identical script that never carries a --home marker and never will — on EVERY invocation,
  # forever, not only during a transient migration window. That made every daemon restart a chance to
  # SIGTERM a legitimate, in-flight, non-legacy process belonging to this SAME instance's own
  # sol-trade pass. No argv-shape pattern can safely tell "stale long-lived loop" apart from
  # "legitimate short-lived one-shot" here, so this is no longer done in code at all. The one-time
  # migration of any still-running pre-29023a55 legacy poster LOOP is now a documented, ONE-TIME
