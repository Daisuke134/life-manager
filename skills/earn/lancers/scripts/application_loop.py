# and one query runs per pass, so the board the lane saw was short-video editing, on-site filming and
# Threads management. It then declined all of it -- 17 mandatory_attribute_fabrication,
# 14 mandatory_human_presence, 14 video_or_animation in the last 60 decisions -- and applied to
# nothing. The lane was fetching work it is honest enough to refuse.
#
# All 20 catalogue listings are system and automation build work, so every term below is a noun
# phrase taken from one of their titles. Noun phrases, not titles: the recipe records that
# "業務自動化システムを開発" finds nothing while "業務自動化" returns a live board.

# twelve searches on a board that is already busy.

# Twelve development nouns saw eighteen postings across the whole of Lancers on 2026-09-07, and

# every minute while being entirely correct. Development is what the fleet is best at, not the
# limit of what it can deliver: Dais 2026-09-07, "they prefer 開発 but it's not the only thing
# they can work on ... buyma not good and sns posting itself and physical shit but all others
# they could do". The refusals live in marketplace-core/work_fit.py and are judged against the
# posting text, so discovery does not need to pre-filter -- it needs to find enough to judge.
#
# Nothing here searches for video, filming, voice, on-site work, 出品代行 or SNS 投稿代行. Those
# are refused, so searching for them only manufactures skips, which is what DEFAULT_DISCOVERY_QUERY
