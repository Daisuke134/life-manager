The allow-list this replaces was itself introduced as "measured, not guessed", was widened once
for the categories it had wrongly refused, and was still refusing 59 of 98 open postings a week
later -- including one of the very categories it had been widened for. So the test that matters
is not "does the list contain the right words" but "of the labels the marketplace really emitted,
does exactly the unworkable ones get refused".
