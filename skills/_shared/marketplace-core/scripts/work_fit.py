"""What the fleet refuses, in one place, for every marketplace.

Each adapter had grown its own answer to "should we bid on this", and they disagreed in the
expensive direction. Measured 2026-09-07:

    Lancers     an eight-class refusal list judged by an LLM against the posting text
    Coconala    an LLM planner with its own, separately worded, list
    CrowdWorks  no judgement at all -- an allow-list of fifteen development category words,
                which rejected 59 of 98 open postings including 「HTML・CSSコーディング」 and
                「AI・チャットボット開発」, both of which the catalogue sells

The allow-list is the mistake worth naming. Development is what the fleet is best at, not the
only thing it can deliver, so enumerating what it may take on has to be wrong every time the
marketplace invents a category name. The refusals are the short, stable list; everything else
is workable.

`HARD_PROHIBITION_CLASSES` is for adapters that put the posting text in front of a model.
`category_refusal` is for adapters that only have a category label, and is deliberately narrow:
a label is thin evidence, so it may only refuse on words that cannot mean anything else.
