# ── gig browser (coconala:kosuke) ──
# The gig Apply/Paid/Storefront lanes do not work in the daily-driver: browser-guard resolves
# coconala:kosuke to its own Chrome on its own profile. :9222 and that browser were once the same
# process behind a proxy, so warming :9222 warmed both; once they were split, nothing warmed the
# gig one and its Coconala session rotted exactly the way a cold clip profile does.
#
# Measured 2026-09-07: /mypage and /offers/add/<id> both redirected to the top page on the gig
# browser while :9222 stayed logged in, so this keepalive reported healthy for four days while
# Coconala applied to nothing. The lane itself said so on every listing -- "公式ページで募集受付中の
# 応募フォームを確認できなかったためです" -- but nothing ever tied that to the session.
#
# The lease is the concurrency contract: BUSY means a gig lane is driving that browser right now,
# which is itself traffic, so skipping is correct and never forces a tab into a live pass.

  # one second after the first successful pass. Gating on the lease means the one job that can heal
  # a dead session almost never runs, which is the opposite of what it is for.
  #
  # Not taking it is correct rather than merely convenient: the four gig lanes already work as
